CLASS AND OBEJET


OBJECT----------------------

THE TEMPLATE ON BLUE PRINT THE DEFINES THE METHOD AND VARIABLE FOR A SPECIFIC TYPE OF OBJECT

an instance of a class that contain the real values insted of variable
object have behaviour and state



	new
	new instance
        object cloning


	INTENCE VARIABLE-------------------


instence variable are accessible to the entire class.they are created and destroyed along with the object.

These variable or declear the class for outside the method always get a default variable


STATIC VARIABLES-----------------------------

Static variable is a variable contains the single copy of the variable and shade amoung
all object static variable are global variables

COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK------------------------------------------


	The collection framework contain interfaces,classes,itrartors to implements
various datastructure and algorithums


ARRAY LIST-----------------------------------------------------


	Array list is the part of collection framework and it provides in DYNAMIC ARRAY IN JVA
	
	It is slower then standard array

ADVANTAGES OF ARRAY LIST-----------------------------------------

	=>>cannot be used for primitive datatype like int,char,ect....In such case we need wrapper class.
	=>>Array list is not synchronized.
	=>>Array list allows duplicate values. List allows duplicate but it mantain the oder of the subject (odered collection)

WHEN ARRAYLIST CAN REMOVE DUPLICATE

	=>>Create a linked hashset from this array list it will remove the duplicate
	=>>Convert this hashset back to array list.
	=>>The second arraylist contains the element with duplicate removed.

Module-2(Defintion)
===================
What is Object?
An object is a entity which has its own states and behaviour.
state refers to variables/datamembers and behaviour refers to
methods/memberfunction.


What is class?
A class is a java definition block or a java blueprint which
contains states and behaviour.
state refers to variables/datamembers and behaviour refers to
methods/memberfunction.


What is reference variable?
It is an identifier which is used to refer to the object that is present
in the heap memory.


What is constructor?
A constructor is a special method or a special memberfunction
of the class which will have the same name as that of the class
name.	



Why do we use constructor?
Constructors are used to initialize the non-static variables that
are present inside the object.


What is Constructor calling?
The process of calling one constructor from another constructor within the same class is known as Constructor calling.
we used "this()" for performing Constructor calling 


What is Constructor chaining?
The process of calling super class constructor from sub class constructor is known as Constructor chaining.
we used "super()" for performing Constructor chaining


What is Inheritance?
One class aquiring the properties of another class is known as 
Inheritance.
It is also known as IS-A relationship.
we use "extends" keyword to perform inheritance.


What is method overloading?
The process of writing multiple methods within the same class 
which are having same name but different in their arguments is known as
method overloading.
Example:
---------
Amazon payment module
IRCTC train search module


What is method overriding?
The Process of Changing super class method implementation in the subclass is known
as Method Overriding.
is-a relationship is mandatory to perform overriding.
While Overriding method name and arguments must be same.
Example:
--------
Upgrade a existing feature
update a existing feature


What is Polymorphism?
One Object showing different behaviour in different stages of its life 
is known as Polymorphism.
types:
Compile time polymorphism
Run time polymorphism


What is Encapsulation?
The Process of Binding related data together is known as Encapsulation.
eg:
---
A class is an encapsulation of datamembers and memberfunction
A package is a encapsulation of class and interface
A rt.jar file is a encapsulation of java executable files


What is abstract class?
A class which is declared using "abstract" keyword is known as abstract
class.
if a class contains atleast one abstract method then it is mandatory to
decalare the class as abstract.


What is Interface?
A interface is a java definition block or a java blueprint which
contains states and behaviour.
state refers to variables/datamembers and behaviour refers to
methods/memberfunction.
every variable is by default static and final
every method is by default public and abstract


What is Abstraction?
The process of hiding the implementation and giving only the functionality
to the user is known as Abstraction.
In java Abstraction can be achieved in 2 ways,
using Abstract class
using Interface


What is typecasting?
The process of converting one type of information to another type of 
information is known as typecasting.
types:
-------
Data typecasting
class typecasting


What is data typecasting?
The process of converting one primitive type data to another primitive type
is known as data typecasting


What is class typecasting?
The process of converting one class type information to another 
class type is known as class typecasting.
to perform class typecasting IS-A relationship is mandatory.
types:
------
Upcasting 
Downcasting


What is upcasting?
The process of converting subclass type information to superclass type
is know as upcasting.
(or)
Assigning subclass object to superclass reference variable is known as 
upcasting.


What is downcasting?
The process of converting superclass type information to subclass type
is know as downcasting.
(or)
Assigning superclass object to subclass reference variable is known as 
downcasting.

When do we get ClassCastException?
Whenever we try to perform downcasting without doing upcasting we will end up getting ClassCastException.


Why multiple inheritance is not allowed in java?
As per java rule when ever we create subclass object its super class constructor must be called inorder
to complete the constructor chaining process.
Since in mutiple inheritance one subclass will have more than one superclass , when we create object of the subclass
the jvm will get confuse which superclass constructor it should execute first to complete the constrcutor chaining.
To avoid this confusion multiple inheritance is not allowed in java.
